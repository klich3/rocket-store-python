***Using the filesystem as a searchable database.***

Rocketstore is a Python library for data storage. It provides an interface for storing and retrieving data in various formats.

***ORIGINAL / NODE VERSION:*** https://github.com/Paragi/rocket-store/

You can download from PyPi repository: https://pypi.org/project/Rocket-Store/

# Basic terminology

Rocket-Store was made to replace a more complex database, in a setting that required a low footprint and high performance.

Rocket-Store is intended to store and retrieve records/documents, organized in collections, using a key.

Terms used:
* __Collection__: name of a collections of records. (Like an SQL table)
* __Record__: the data store. (Like an SQL row)
* __Data storage area__: area/directory where collections are stored. (Like SQL data base)
* __Key__: every record has exactly one unique key, which is the same as a file name (same restrictions) and the same wildcards used in searches.

Compare Rocket-Store, SQL and file system terms:

| Rocket-Store | SQL| File system |
|---|---|---
| __storage area__     |  database     |  data directory root   |
| __collection__       |  table        |  directory             |
| __key__              |  key          |  file name             |
| __record__           |  row          |  file                  |


## Features

- Support for file locking.
- Support for creating data storage directories.
- Support for adding auto incrementing sequences and GUIDs to keys.


## Usage

To use Rocketstore, you must first import the library:

```python
from Rocketstore import Rocketstore, _FORMAT_JSON
```

### Post

```python
rs.post(collection="delete_fodders1", key="1", record={"some":"json input"}, flags=_FORMAT_JSON)
# or
rs.post("delete_fodders1", "1", {"some":"json input"}, _FORMAT_JSON)
```

Stores a record in a collection identified by a unique key

__Collection__ name to contain the records.

__Key__ uniquely identifying the record

No path separators or wildcards etc. are allowed in collection names and keys.
Illigal charakters are silently striped off.

__Content__ Data input to store

__Options__
  * _ADD_AUTO_INC:  Add an auto incremented sequence to the beginning of the key
  * _ADD_GUID: Add a Globally Unique IDentifier to the key

__Returns__ an associative array containing the result of the operation:
* count : number of records affected (1 on succes)
* key:   string containing the actual key used


If the key already exists, the record will be replaced.

If no key is given, an auto-incremented sequence is used as key.

If the function fails for any reason, an error is thrown.

### Get

Find and retrieve records, in a collection.

```python
rs.get(collection="delete_fodders1")
# or
rs.get("delete_fodders1")
# Get wildcar
rs.get("delete_*")
```

__Collection__ to search. If no collection name is given, get will return a list of data base assets: collections and sequences etc.

__Key__ to search for. Can be mixed with wildcards '\*' and '?'. An undefined or empty key is the equivalent of '*'

__Options__:
  * _ORDER       : Results returned are ordered alphabetically ascending.
  * _ORDER_DESC  : Results returned are ordered alphabetically descending.
  * _KEYS        : Return keys only (no records)
  * _COUNT       : Return record count only

__Return__ an array of
* count   : number of records affected
* key     : array of keys
* result  : array of records

NB: wildcards are very expensive on large datasets with most filesystems.
(on a regular PC with +10^7 records in the collection, it might take up to a second to retreive one record, whereas one might retrieve up to 100.000 records with an exact key match)

### Delete

Delete one or more records, whos key match.

```python
# Delete database
rs.delete()

# Delete collection with content
rs.delete("delete_fodders1")

# Delete wild collection 
rs.delete("delete_*")

# Delete exact key
rs.delete("delete_fodders1", "1")

```

__Collection__ to search. If no collection is given, **THE WHOLE DATA BASE IS DELETED!**

__Key__ to search for. Can be mixed with wildcards '\*' and '?'. If no key is given, **THE ENTIRE COLLECTION INCLUDING SEQUENCES IS DELETED!**

__Return__ an array of
* count : number of records or collections affected

### Options

Can be called at any time to change the configuration values of the initialized instance

__Options__:
  * data_storage_area: The directory where the database resides. The default is to use a subdirectory to the temporary directory provided by the operating system. If that doesn't work, the DOCUMENT_ROOT directory is used.
  * data_format: Specify which format the records are stored in. Values are: _FORMAT_NATIVE - default. and RS_FORMAT_JSON - Use JSON data format.

```python
rs.options(data_format=_FORMAT_JSON)
# or
rs.options(**{
  "data_format": _FORMAT_JSON,
  ...
})
```

#### Inserting with Globally Unique IDentifier key

Another option is to add a GUID to the key.
The GUID is a combination of a timestamp and a random sequence, formatet in accordance to  RFC 4122 (Valid but slightly less random)

If ID's are generated more than 1 millisecond apart, they are 100% unique.
If two ID's are generated at shorter intervals, the likelyhod of collission is up to 1 of 10^15.
